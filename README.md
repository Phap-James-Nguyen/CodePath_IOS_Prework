## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

YouTube

Some ideas that I have for my app are to add in a toggle slider function where users can slide left and right, and up and down to navigate over the screen. This way, users can slide around and see what they want on the screen. I would also like to add in Video links, similar to how YouTube has its UI so that users can click on the video and view. Furthermore, I would like my app to have tab bars either on the bottom or on the side so that users can switch to different settings like Home page, Setting page, etc.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I encountered while building this app are 

1) Figuring out where certain things were. For example, I had issue finding Adjust Editor Option
2) When I run the app, it did not function as intended. This happened when I ran the app and clicked the change button; at first it did not do anything.
